# Neural_Networks_Intelligent_Systems_NTUA

Projects for Neural Networks and Intelligent Systems course, ECE NTUA 2021-2022.

The following projects are included:

* Supervised learning:  
  Experiments are performed on image classification using multiple classifiers (Dummy, Gaussian Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic Regression). Dimensionality reduction using a variance threshold and using PCA,
  standardization, MinMax scaling, oversampling, undersampling, grid search, cross validation, and ML pipelines are explored. Two datasets are used: the EEG Eye State dataset and the Sloan Digital
  Sky Survey DR16 dataset.
  
* Unsupervised learning:  
 In the first part, a movie recommendation system is implemented. Text preprocessing (stop-word removal, stemming, lemmatization etc.), TF-IDF vectorization, and the usage of pre-trained word embeddings are explored.  In the second part, a topological and semantic representation of movies using self organizing maps (S0M) is created.
